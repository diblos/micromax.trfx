Once you’ve climbed the 246 steps to the top, your guide will point out beautifully carved statues of the Buddha interspersed among the stalactites and stalagmites. Hear the legend of the 19th-century Chinese monk who discovered the cave and learn how the temple was later constructed.

Delight in the novelty of walking with your guide through the natural mangrove forest along a boardwalk. As Kuala Sepetang produces the bulk of the nation’s top quality mangrove charcoal, you’ll also visit a charcoal kiln where charcoals are produced.

Your guide will lead you to top cultural attractions in Georgetown, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. View the third longest reclining Buddha figure in the world, followed by a visit to KekLok Si Temple, also known as Pagoda of Ten Thousand Buddhas. Built in 1904, it is the largest Buddhist temple complex in Southeast Asia. Climb the steps to the temple, which includes a magnificent bronze statue of Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, and a seven-story pagoda featuring 10,000 alabaster and bronze Buddha statues. Continue by coach to Fort Cornwallis, the landing site of Captain Francis Light when he arrived in 1786 to start the first British colony in Penang. Inside the fort walls there are original structures like the chapel, prison cells, munitions storage, bronze canons and flagstaff belonging to the English East India Company. Then head to the waterfront village of the Weld Quay Clan Jetties, one of the last remaining old Chinese settlements on the island, where you’ll find houses built on stilts along the planks. Driving along Pitt Street, also known as the ‘Street of Harmony,’ view the churches, Chinese temples, mosques and Hindu temples that have stood side by side for centuries in harmonious existence. Visit the intricate KhooKongsi clan house — part of a closely-knit network of Chinese clan associations established in Malaysia since the mid-19th century. Finally, enjoy a breezy trishaw ride, still a popular mode of transport in Georgetown. Pass charming colonial buildings and modern skyscrapers before returning to your hotel to spend the rest of your day at your leisure. Overnight: Bayview Beach Resort in Penang."

Opposite, the English Tudor styled Royal Selangor Club sits facing the SAS Building. Head on over to the old railway station to see a couple more of the Neo Moorish and Mughal designed buildings. In the old city area, many shop houses don the old pre-war structures where you get to see a mix of influences in designs from Grecian-Spanish, neo-Gothic, Victorian and even the American styles that range from 1880s till 1950s."

Under the guidance of your professional instructor, learn to concoct refreshing beverages and cook local favourites from scratch, such as nasilemak (a coconut milk–based rice dish), assamlaksa (a fish-based soup) and tandoori chicken. Engulfed in a cloud of fragrant aromas, enjoy the fruits of your labour as lunch is served on the Pavilion.

Your guide takes you on a drive through Penang’s historical downtown, featuring prominent landmarks of interest. Your first stop is in Chinatown at KhooKongsi, a magnificent clan house surrounded by terrace houses and shops. Once part of a network of Chinese clan associations established during the mid-19th century in Malaysia, the traditional building showcases intricate woodwork of master craftsmen. After learning about this architectural heritage from your guide, head to Pinang Peranakan Mansion, built at the end of the 19th century. Following decades of neglect, the stately home was restored to its former glory and now incorporates an eclectic style of Chinese wood-carved panels, English floor tiles and Scottish ironworks. As you tour the opulent heritage home with more than 1,000 antiques on display, hear about the lifestyle and customs of the Peranakans, a prominent community also known as Straits Chinese. Next up is Fort Corwallis, established by the English East India Company after the 1786 arrival of Captain Francis Light. Follow your guide on foot around the fort’s perimeter of 10-foot-high (3-meter) walls and head inside for a look at the century-old chapel, prison cells, munitions storage, bronze canons and flagstaff. At the end of your tour, you can enjoy various street arts and further indulge in street food unique to Penang (own expense). Perhaps try curry mee (thin noodles in curry broth) or bite into delicious desserts like ice kachang (shaved ice that includes jelly, red beans and sweet corn). Your afternoon and evening are free to spend as you wish. Select your own choice of cuisine for dinner; perhaps trying Mamak (Indian Muslim), Hainan/Hakka (Chinese), Malay or international dishes (own expense).

After being driven to the Georgetown station, board the Penang Hill Railway and travel approximately 10 to 20 minutes up Penang Hill, with views of the surrounding lush mountains on display along the way. Upon arrival at the top, marvel at the old English colonial charm of David's Brown restaurant, tucked away on Penang Hill and surrounded by greenery, well-manicured gardens and a beautiful lily pond. Dig into a delicious dish of either fine British cuisine or traditional Penang specialties. While being served by the friendly and professional staff, admire not only the restaurant's elegant colonial furnishings, but most especially the incredible panoramic view of Georgetown at night. After your delightful meal, board the railway once again and be dropped off at your Penang hotel."
